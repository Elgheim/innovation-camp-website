          <div class="development-beskrivelse">
            <p>In Koonan elemtary school, Ivory Coast, there was put in place a trial project, where the
              aim was to include parants and community as much as possible. Starting times were adjusted to fit
              the majority. Twice a week parants that had time, could come and eat lunsj with their
              children. The project startet 8 months ago and thanks to everyone at Koonan elemtary school,
              we get rapports that drop-out rate has fallen 83% and the parents loves seeing their children
              happy at school. We are now looking to increase this project to other schools.

            <p>At Save the Children we belive that every child deserves the opurtunity
            to go to school. We're working hard across the world, so that every child can be able to learn and
            grow. One part of the problem is building enough school, the other part of the problem is keeping
            the children at school. More often than not, it's not the childs fault their dropping out. At the core,
            these new projects aim to learn more about effective meassurements to decrease dropouts.</p>
